# üíº Course-Based Job Recommendation System

## üìò Project Description
This project aims to build a recommendation system that suggests relevant job opportunities based on the courses (training/certifications) a user chooses. The goal is to help users answer "After completing this course, what kinds of jobs might be suitable for me?" questions. The system uses Content-Based Filtering, where recommendations are generated by analyzing the content of the course and comparing it to the content of job postings. It focuses on the skills and subcategory found in both the courses and the jobs. The more similar the content, the higher the job appears in the recommendation list. Instead of matching jobs manually, the system automatically compares the skills and topics covered in the course to the skill requirements listed in job postings. Then, it recommends the most relevant jobs based on that comparison.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
- **Vectorization**  
  To compare course and job content, all textual information (skills and subcategory) must be converted into numerical form. Word2Vec is used to convert each word into a vector that captures its meaning and context. For example, it recognizes that "data science" is more similar to "machine learning" than to "customer service". Each course and job is represented by a list of important words (tokens), for example ["python", "data", "visualization"]. These tokens are converted into vectors using Word2Vec, and then averaged to create a single vector representation per course or job. It works well with lists of skills and descriptions, making it ideal for job and course content
- **Cosine Similarity**  
  After the vectors are created, we use cosine similarity to compare the course vector with each job vector. Cosine similarity works well for high-dimensional data (like word embeddings) and focuses on relative similarity, not just raw values.

## üîéRecommendation System Results
This system recommends jobs based on the content of a course selected by the user. It compares the skills and keywords in the course with the skill requirements found in real job postings. The user can also choose to filter results by job category or let the system search across all available jobs.
- **Example 1**  
  Course Selected: Computer Security and Systems Management  
  Category Filter: None  

  | Recommended Job Title               | Job Category                |
  |------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | Dosen Teknologi Informasi          | Pendidikan Dan Pelatihan    |
  | IT Programmer                      | IT / Information Technology |
  | Staff Backend Programmer           | IT / Information Technology |
  | Staff Teknisi CCTV                 | IT / Information Technology |
  | Guru Teknik Komputer dan Jaringan | Pendidikan Dan Pelatihan    |

  The recommended jobs generally fall within the IT field, which aligns with the course domain. However, the results tend to lean toward broader roles and may not fully capture the course's specific focus on computer security and systems management. This suggests there is still room to enhance the system‚Äôs precision in identifying more specialized job matches.

- **Example 2**  
  Course Selected: Digital Marketing  
  Category Filter: Marketing / Pemasaran  

  | Recommended Job Title       | Job Category           |
  |----------------------------|------------------------|
  | Marketing Executive        | Marketing / Pemasaran  |
  | Social Media Specialist    | Marketing / Pemasaran  |
  | Marketing                  | Marketing / Pemasaran  |
  | SEO & SEM Advertiser       | Marketing / Pemasaran  |
  | Marketing Konstruksi       | Marketing / Pemasaran  |

  This example show better alignment after applying a category filter. The recommended jobs are more aligned with the course content, focusing on roles within the digital marketing field. While some recommended job remain broad, the overall matches are more relevant and targeted, indicating that the filter helps enhance the system's precision. Still, the recommendations can be further improved to better reflect the course focus.

## üß© Challenges  
One challenge I noticed during the project was that some of the recommended jobs didn‚Äôt feel very suitable or relevant to the course. To improve the relevance of the results, I explored different ways to refine the recommendations. One of the approaches I tried that was successful was adding a category filter, so the system could focus on jobs within a specific field if needed. This helped make the results more targeted and better aligned with the intent behind taking a course  and gave me a clearer understanding of how small adjustments can significantly impact the quality of recommendations

## üìÅ Notes: Repository Structure  
  This repository is organized into three main folders to support the development and execution of the recommendation system:
  - The data folder contains the input datasets in .csv format, including course information and job postings with relevant skills and descriptions.
  - The results folder stores the output of the vectorization process and the similarity mapping results used to generate the job recommendations.
  - The code folder includes the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) that implements the entire pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to vectorization, similarity calculation, and generating recommendations.
